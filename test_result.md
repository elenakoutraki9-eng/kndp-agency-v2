# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Verify two edits on the KNDP agency site (https://adc6e2d0-c096-4dc6-b5fb-97e5250e49b9.preview.emergentagent.com/): 1. Services section: the top 4-card 'offerings' bento grid (cards titled 'Websites & Web Apps', 'Custom Tools & Programs', 'Automations', 'Mobile Apps', data-testid='offering-card-0' through 'offering-card-3') has been REMOVED. Confirm those cards no longer exist, and the Services section now flows directly from the headline ('If it lives on a screen, we can build it.') into the 'A few examples' idea cards section with no big empty gap or leftover spacing. The 3 grouped service categories (customers/team/operations, 8 cards) below should still be intact and working, including 'Let's talk' buttons scrolling to contact. 2. FAQ section (data-testid='faq-section'): padding, headline size, and each FAQ item's spacing/text size were reduced to make it more compact. Confirm the section looks visibly smaller than before, all 5 FAQ items (data-testid='faq-item-0' through 'faq-item-4') still expand/collapse correctly on click showing their answers, and there's no text overlap or clipping. Check both 1440x900 desktop and 390x844 mobile. 3. No console errors. Quick regression: hero, portfolio carousel, and contact form submission still work."
